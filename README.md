# Raycast Memory Monitor

A lightweight macOS shell script that automatically monitors and manages Raycast‚Äôs memory usage.
If Raycast consumes more than a defined memory threshold (default: 500 MB), the script will automatically restart the app and notify the user.


## Features

- Monitors Raycast‚Äôs memory usage periodically

- Automatically restarts Raycast when memory exceeds threshold

- Sends macOS system notifications on restart (optional if IBM Notifier is installed)

- Writes detailed logs for each check

- Runs automatically via macOS LaunchAgent (no manual execution needed)


## Configuration

| Setting | Description | Default |
|----------|--------------|----------|
| `APP_NAME` | Application name to monitor | `Raycast` |
| `MEM_THRESHOLD_MB` | Memory threshold (in MB) before restart | `500` |
| `LOG_FILE` | Path to the log file | `~/raycast_mem_monitor.log` |
| `StartInterval` | Memory check frequency | `3600` |


## Installation

1. **Copy the script**
```bash
vi ~/raycast_mem_monitor.sh
```
Paste the script content and save.

2. **Make it executable**
```bash
chmod +x ~/raycast_mem_monitor.sh
```

3. **Create the LaunchAgent**
```bash
vi ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.raycastmem.plist
```
Paste the script content and change `[USERNAME]` to your device name.

4. **Load the task**
```bash
launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.raycastmem.plist
```


## Logs

All activity is logged to:
```bash
~/raycast_mem_monitor.log
```
Each entry includes a timestamp, current memory usage, and restart actions.


## Notes
- If you want to use system notification, please install [IBM Notifier](https://github.com/IBM/mac-ibm-notifications).

- Modify `StartInterval` to change the check frequency (e.g., 3600 = 1 hour).

- Modify `MEM_THRESHOLD_MB` to meet your management needs.

- To stop the service:
```bash
launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.user.raycastmem.plist
```
